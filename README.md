# Aircraft problem

## Overview

This application implements the aircraft queueing problem in angular.

### Problem:
A software subsystem of an air-traffic control system is defined to manage a queue of aircraft (AC) in an airport.
The aircraft queue is managed by a process which responds to three types of requests:

- system boot used to start the system.
- enqueue aircraft used to insert a new AC into the system.
- dequeue aircraft used to remove an AC from the system.

AC’s have the following properties:
- AC type: Passenger or Cargo
- AC size: Small or Large

The process which manages the queue of AC’s satisfies the following:

- There is no limit on the number of AC’s it can manage
- Dequeue aircraft requests result in selection of one AC for removal such that:
- Passenger AC’s have removal precedence over Cargo AC’s
- Large AC’s of a given type have removal precedence over Small AC’s of the same type.
- Earlier enqueued AC’s of a given type and size have precedence over later enqueued AC’s of the same type and size.

Angular Deliverable:
- Your HTML page should have a button to boot the system,
- a selector(s) to enqueue aircraft,
- and a button to dequeue aircraft (when pressed a message stating which aircraft was dequeued)
- Tests (testing on this app will be a big plus; show us that you drive your development with tests)

There should be a tab or link to take the user to another view that shows the current state of the enqueued airplanes.


## Prerequisites

### Node.js and Tools

- Get [Node.js][node-download].
- Install the tool dependencies (`npm install`).


## Workings of the application

- The application filesystem layout structure is based on the [angular-seed] project.
- There is no dynamic backend (no application server) for this application.

## Development

The following docs describe how you can test and develop further this application.


### Installing dependencies

The application relies upon various node.js tools, such as Bower, Karma and Protractor.  You can
install these by running:

```
npm install
```

This will also run bower, which will download the angular files needed for the application.

### Running the app during development

- Run `npm start`
- navigate your browser to `http://localhost:8000/app/index.html` to see the app running in your browser.

### Running unit tests

We recommend using [Jasmine][jasmine] and [Karma][karma] for your unit tests/specs

- Start Karma with `npm test`
  - A browser will start and connect to the Karma server. Chrome is the default browser, others can
  be captured by loading the same url as the one in Chrome or by changing the `test/karma.conf.js`
  file.
- Karma will sit and watch your application and test JavaScript files. To run or re-run tests just
  change any of your these files.


### End to end testing

We recommend using [Jasmine][jasmine] and [Protractor][protractor] for end-to-end testing.

Requires a webserver that serves the application. See Running the app during development, above.

- Serve the application: run `npm start`.
- In a separate console run the end2end tests: `npm run protractor`. Protractor will execute the
  end2end test scripts against the web application itself.
  - The configuration is set up to run the tests on Chrome directly. If you want to run against
    other browsers then you must install the webDriver, `npm run update-webdriver`, and modify the
  configuration at `test/protractor-conf.js`.
